First an important note: There are more suitable libraries for ENC28J60 with ESP8266, RP2040, ESP32 and Mbed Arduino platforms: 

* With ESP8266 and RP2040 platform you can use the EthernetCompat.h from the lwIP_enc28j60 bundled library. 
* With ESP32 platform version 3 you can use the [EthernetESP32](https://github.com/Networking-for-Arduino/EthernetESP32) library which integrates with networking on the ESP32 platform. 
* With Arduino Mbed Core boards you can use the [ENC28J60-EMAC](https://github.com/Networking-for-Arduino/ENC28J60-EMAC) library with the platforms Ethernet library

# EthernetENC

EthernetENC is the Ethernet library for ENC28J60. It is a modern version of [the UIPEthernet library](https://github.com/jandrassy/EthernetENC/wiki/UIPEthernet).

The modernization includes:
* Ethernet 2.0.0 Arduino library functions
* compatible include file names EthernetClient.h, EthernetServer.h and EthernetUdp.h 
* support of many Arduino architectures by using the SPI library
* SPI transactions to share the SPI bus with devices with different communication settings
* SPI communication at 20 MHz if the MCU supports it, else on the maximum supported by the MCU
* client.flush() to send the packet immediately
* calls yield() in blocking functions 
* has UDP backlog to receive more than one message at time
* Arduino 1.5 library format built with dot_a_linkage option  for optimal build result

[The documentation of Arduino Ethernet library](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Reference/Ethernet) applies for classes and functions descriptions.

Limitations:
* UDP.beginMulticast is not supported, because the uIP stack doesn't support multicast
* UDP broadcasts receiving is turned off on ENC to lower the processing load on the library

This library doesn't have examples, because examples of the Arduino Ethernet library apply. You can find them in the Arduino IDE Examples menu Ethernet section. Only change `#include <Ethernet.h>` to `#include <EthernetENC.h>`. Some examples require [a little change](https://github.com/jandrassy/EthernetENC/wiki/Examples).

This library is based on the Norbert Truchsess's arduino-uip original source code repository and uses experience from the development of the multi-architecture support by Cassy. Applicable fixes and enhancements from development of EthernetENC were transfered to Cassy's UIPEthernet.

**You can find more information in project's [Wiki](https://github.com/jandrassy/EthernetENC/wiki).**

## Original notes by Norbert Truchsess

UIPEthernet is written as a wrapper around the mature uIP Stack by Adam Dunkels, which provides the low-level implementation for all supported protocols. To overcome the memory-constrains (a 'regular' uIP-application does all processing in RAM) the ENC28J60 internal memory is used for all stream buffers (in and out). Only 400-600 Bytes of Arduinos RAM are used (depending on the number of concurrently open connections). As of Flash-memory a ATmega368-based Arduino is the minimum requirenment.

uIP was written by Adam Dunkels of the Networked Embedded Systems group at the Swedish Institute of Computer Science.

This library was inspired by the SerialIP implementation by Adam Nielsen <malvineous@shikadi.net>, actually I took this code as a starting point, but in the latest versions there are very few lines left.
